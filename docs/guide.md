# Guides

## Content Editing

#### Add image to article (content)

This is an AMP page, to add image, you have to use [amp-img shortcodes](https://github.com/huyb1991/hugo-lamp/blob/master/layouts/shortcodes/amp-img.html), the syntax is:
```
{{< amp-img width="width-value" height="height-value" layout="responsive" src="image-url" alt="image alt" >}}
```
Replace `width-value`, `height-value`, `image alt` and `image-url` by your image.

Note: Hugo is static-site-generator, to add image to your site, please follow this solution [[SOlved] How toâ€¦ insert image in my post?](https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/solved-how-to-insert-image-in-my-post/1473)

#### Content config for SEO

In Front Matter section for each post, you should add `title` and `description` for SEO, example:

```
---
title: "Getting Started with AMP"
description: "Getting started with AMP. Implement these key steps to get up and running with AMP"
---
```
The `title` is the H1 tag on HTML page, and `<title>` in head section.

The `description` is the meta tag for description `<meta name="description" content="">` in head section.

## Configuration

Take a look at [exampleSite - config.toml](https://github.com/huyb1991/hugo-lamp/blob/master/exampleSite/config.toml), and replace config value by your own:

#### Site Info

```toml
# Base config for your site
baseURL = "http://localhost:1313/"      # Your domain
languageCode = "en-us"
title = "Hugo LAMP"                     # Default site title
theme = "hugo-lamp"
googleAnalytics = "UA-XXXXXXXX-X"       # Google Analytics UA number
```

#### Main Menu

```toml
[[menu.main]]
  name = "Hugo"
  weight = 1
  identifier = "hugo"
  url = "/hugo/"
[[menu.main]]
  name = "AMP Project"
  weight = 2
  identifier = "amp"
  url = "/amp/"
[[menu.main]]
  name = "Tags"
  weight = 3
  identifier = "tags"
  url = "/tags/"
```

#### Taxonomies

For more details, take a look on official document for [taxonomies](https://gohugo.io/content-management/taxonomies/)

```toml
[taxonomies]
  tag = "tags"
  category = "categories"
```

#### SEO

```toml
[params]
  subtitle = "Light responsive AMP theme"
  author = "Huy Nguyen"                     # Your name
  logo = "/img/avatar.jpg"                  # Logo
  description = "A light responsive Hugo AMP theme for blogger"          # Meta description tag
  paginate = 10

  # SEO configs
  seotitle = "Hugo Blog Title (SEO Version)"                  # Overwrite site title for SEO purpose
  googleSiteVerification = "google_site_verification_code"    # Google Webmaster
  msValidate = "bing_site_verification_code"                  # Bing Webmaster
```

#### Publisher

Currently only support Google Adsense as usual, maybe implement [amp-auto-ads](https://www.ampproject.org/docs/reference/components/amp-auto-ads) for future.

```toml
  # Google Adsense
  adsensePublisher = "ca-pub-XXX"       # Required if you want to include Google Adsense
  adsenseSlot = "XXX"                   # Required slot to display ads
  adsenseSlotSticky = "XXX"             # Enables sticky ads feature, value maybe the same with adsenseSlot, remove if you don't want display sticky ads
```

#### Social networks & connections

```toml
  # Social networks
  email = "name@domain.com"
  github = "github_username"
  twitter = "twitter_username"
  linkedin = "linkedin_username"
  facebook = "facebook_username"
  google = "googleplus_id_number"
  instagram = "instagram_username"
  youtube = "youtube_username"
  dribbble = "dribbble_username"
```
